# Welcome to my 15 Puzzle

This project was created as part of a test while looking for a LIA internship. It's built completely with React.

It's a website that contains the classic 15 Puzzle, a game where you re-order tiles from the lowest number to the highest by swapping them around.

In a classic game there's a 4\*4 grid, making it a total of 15 tiles with one empty space. You can only swap the tile that's right next to the empty space.
In this version however, a part of the challenge was to make a customizable game where you can set your own gamesize by adjusting the amount of columns and rows. As well as being able to swap all (or some) tiles alongside the empty space's X- and Y-axis.

It is my first time making any kind of game (except for one quiz) and I feel quite happy about this first attempt. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
